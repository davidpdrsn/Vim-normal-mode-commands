# Vim normal mode commands

People say its a good idea to learn all of Vims normal mode commands. However there are A LOT! I decided to write them all down so others can benefit from it. Yes I realize all this information is also available through the Vim help but I wanted to write them down anyway.

**I'm not quite done adding all the commands but they should be coming soon!**
